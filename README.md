==========================

Web Developer / Data Engineer
-----------------------------

I've been learning coding for a few years. I'm a data engineer/software developer in a technology/data company. I've been using Django frequently lately, and I'm trying to improve myself on back-end and front-end. In my repositories, you can find about various algorithm structures and Python examples. I'm currently adding to my repos something new about HTML, JavaScript or CSS so, you can follow. If you're new to coding you can have a look at my python introduction repository.

*   ðŸ§ Â  I'm learning Django, HTML, JavaScript, CSS
