Hi 👋 My name is Büşra Can
==========================

Web Developer / Data Engineer
-----------------------------

I've been learning coding for a time that I can't remember exactly, but I've been doing it actively for the last 6 months. I'm a data engineer in a technology/data company. Apart from that, I've been using Django frequently lately, and I'm trying to improve myself on back-end and front-end. In my repositories, you can find about various algorithm structures and Python examples. I'm currently adding to my repos something new about HTML, JavaScript or CSS so, you can follow. If you're new to coding you can have a look at my python introduction repository.

*   🌍  I'm living in Turkey
*   🧠  I'm learning Django, HTML, JavaScript, CSS
*   ⚡  Fun fact: I'm the Just Dance queen.
